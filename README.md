# sheetList
Provides a dropdown list to navigate between sheets in a Qlik Sense Application.

Uses the Qlik Sense Mashup API to obtain a list of sheets.
Uses jqueryui to create the dropdown list.  

The dropdown list overflows over other objects, therefore, minimal vertical space required when adding extension to the canvas.

This visualization extension uses api calls and methods from the current release of the Qlik Sense extension and mashup apis.

# sheetList
Provides a dropdown list to navigate between sheets in a Qlik Sense Application.

Uses the Qlik Sense Mashup API to obtain a list of sheets.
Uses jqueryui to create the dropdown list.  

The dropdown list overflows over other objects, therefore, minimal vertical space required when adding extension to the canvas.
